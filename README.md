### Face Recognition Accuracy with various models

---> Principle Component Analysis is used to reduce the dataset and find out prominent features of the dataset

---> Models used - Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes Classifier

---> To check if the given image in the test dataset is accurately predicted or not. 

---> Accuracies for models are as follows :
1. Logistic Regression = 0.93
2. Support Vector Machine = 0.85
3. Naive Bayes Classifier = 0.74
